# Scripting 
## Handling Script Execution 
If you try and run a ps1 script you would get the following error:
```
PS> .\script.ps1
script1.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, 
see about_Execution_Policies at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170
```
To by-pass this, run powershell.exe as admin and type:
```powershell
PS> set-executionpolicy remotesigned
```
## Error Handling 
To capture an error code generated by an exeutable run from within your ps1 file you would need to capture the error code and act on it. This section uses a net use example to 
demonstrate how to handle errors.

### net use using '-replace' and regexp
Trying to map google as a network drive will exit with an error code. For example:
```powershell
ps> net use W: \\216.58.194.164
System error 67 has occurred.

The network name cannot be found.
```
We would like to catch the 67 error code so that we could handle it.
Have a look at net-use.ps1 script in the current folder. It includes execution instructions as well as explaination and excpected output.
