# Scripting 
## Error Handling 
To capture an error code generated by an exeutable run from within your ps1 file you would need to capture the error code and act on it. This section uses a net use example to 
demonstrate how to handle errors.

### net use using '-replace' and regexp
Trying to map google as a network drive will exit with an error code. For example:
```powershell
ps> net use W: \\216.58.194.164
System error 67 has occurred.

The network name cannot be found.
```
We would like to catch the 67 error code so that we could handle it.
